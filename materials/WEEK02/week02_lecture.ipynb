The Print Function - Your First Tool\n\nBefore we explore variables, let's start with the `print()` function. This is the most basic way to display information in Python.\n\nThink of `print()` as your way of telling the computer to \"show this on the screen.\" It's like having a conversation with your computer - you can make it display text, numbers, or any information you want to see.\n\n### Basic Print Examples","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This is a comment - Python ignores everything after the # symbol\n# Let's start with a simple greeting\n\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\nprint(\"Welcome to Python programming!\")","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"When we run this code, Python displays the text inside the quotes.

Variables as Containers Concept\n\n### What is a Variable?\n\nImagine you have a box in your room. You can put something inside it and put a label on the outside so you know what's inside. Variables in Python work exactly the same way!\n\n- **The box** = the computer's memory space\n- **The label** = the variable name\n- **What's inside** = the value/data\n\n### Creating Your First Variable\n\nIn Python, we create variables using the assignment operator `=`. The format is:\n```\nvariable_name = value\n```","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Creating a variable - like putting \"Batman\" in a box labeled \"hero_name\"\nhero_name = \"Batman\"\n\n# Now let's see what's in our \"box\"\nprint(hero_name)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"What happened here? \n1. We created a \"box\" (variable) called `hero_name`\n2. We put the value `\"Batman\"` inside it\n3.

Four Basic Data Types\n\nJust like in real life, we store different types of things in different ways. In Python, there are four basic types of data you'll work with:\n\n### 1. String - Text Data\n\n**Strings** are text - anything you want to treat as words, letters, or characters. They're always surrounded by quotes (either single ' or double \").","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# String examples - notice the quotes!\nname = \"Alice\"\nfavorite_color = 'blue'\nmessage = \"Hello, how are you today?\"\neven_numbers_can_be_strings = \"123\"\n\nprint(\"Name:\", name)\nprint(\"Favorite color:\", favorite_color)\nprint(\"Message:\", message)\nprint(\"Numbers as text:\", even_numbers_can_be_strings)\n\n# You can check the type of any variable\nprint(\"Type of name:\", type(name))","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2.

Variable Naming Rules\n\nJust like you can't name your pet anything you want (imagine trying to call a dog \"!!!\" at the park), Python has rules for naming variables.\n\n### The Rules (You MUST Follow These):\n\n1. **Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or underscore (_)**\n2. **Cannot start with a number**\n3. **Can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores**\n4. **No spaces allowed**\n5. **Cannot use Python keywords** (like `print`, `if`, `for`, etc.)\n6. **Case sensitive** (`Name` and `name` are different)\n\n### Good Examples:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# GOOD variable names - these all work\nuser_name = \"John\"\nage2 = 25\nis_valid = True\n_private_var = \"secret\"\nfirstName = \"Jane\"\nCONSTANT_VALUE = 100\n\nprint(\"All of these work fine!\")\nprint(user_name, age2, is_valid)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Bad Examples (These Cause Errors):","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# BAD variable names - these would cause errors if uncommented\n\n# 2age = 25          # Error: Can't start with number\n# user name = \"John\" # Error: No spaces allowed\n# user-name = \"Jane\" # Error: No dashes allowed\n# print = \"Hello\"    # Error: Can't use Python keywords","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Best Practices (Not Required, But Recommended):\n\n- Use **descriptive names**: `student_grade` instead of `sg`\n- Use **snake_case** for multiple words: `first_name` not `firstname`\n- Use **lowercase** for regular variables\n- Use **UPPERCASE** for constants (values that never change)\n- Start **boolean** variables with `is_` or `has_`: `is_valid`, `has_license`","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Examples of well-named variables\nstudent_name = \"Alice\"\nfinal_grade = 87.5\nis_passing = True\nMAX_STUDENTS = 30  # Constant - never changes\n\nprint(f\"Student: {student_name}\")\nprint(f\"Grade: {final_grade}\")\nprint(f\"Passing: {is_passing}\")\nprint(f\"Class limit: {MAX_STUDENTS}\")","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here's an example of fixing bad variable names:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Examples of incorrect variable names and their fixes:\n# 1st_name = \"Bob\"        # WRONG: Can't start with number\n# user age = 30           # WRONG: No spaces allowed  \n# is-valid = True         # WRONG: No dashes allowed\n\n# Corrected versions:\nfirst_name = \"Bob\"        # CORRECT: starts with letter\nuser_age = 30            # CORRECT: underscore instead of space\nis_valid = True          # CORRECT: underscore instead of dash\n\nprint(\"Corrected variables:\", first_name, user_age, is_valid)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n## 5. Essential Homework Prep\n\n### Type Conversion Preview\n\nSometimes you need to convert data from one type to another. It's like taking something out of one box and putting it in a different type of box.\n\n**Common conversions:**\n- `int()` - converts to integer\n- `float()` - converts to float  \n- `str()` - converts to string\n- `bool()` - converts to boolean","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Type conversion examples\n\n# Converting string numbers to actual numbers\ntext_number = \"25\"\nreal_number = int(text_number)  # Convert string to integer\n\nprint(\"Text number:\", text_number, \"- Type:\", type(text_number))\nprint(\"Real number:\", real_number, \"- Type:\", type(real_number))\n\n# Now we can do math with it!\nprint(\"Real number + 5 =\", real_number + 5)\n# The next line would cause an error:\n# print(\"Text number + 5 =\", text_number + 5)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# More conversion examples\nnumber = 42\ndecimal = 3.14\ntext = \"Hello\"\n\nprint(\"Original values:\")\nprint(f\"Number: {number} ({type(number)})\")\nprint(f\"Decimal: {decimal} ({type(decimal)})\")\nprint(f\"Text: {text} ({type(text)})\")\n\nprint(\"\\nAfter conversion:\")\nprint(f\"Number as string: {str(number)} ({type(str(number))})\")\nprint(f\"Decimal as integer: {int(decimal)} ({type(int(decimal))})\")\nprint(f\"Number as float: {float(number)} ({type(float(number))})\")","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Important Note:** Not all conversions work!

Summary and Key Takeaways\n\nToday we covered the fundamental building blocks of Python programming:\n\n### What We Covered:\n\n1. **Print Function**: How to display information using `print()`\n2. **Variables**: How to store data in labeled containers\n3. **Four Data Types**:\n   - **String**: Text in quotes (`\"Hello\"`)\n   - **Integer**: Whole numbers (`42`)\n   - **Float**: Decimal numbers (`3.14`)\n   - **Boolean**: True/False values (`True`, `False`)\n4. **Variable Naming**: Rules and best practices\n5. **Type Conversion**: How to change data types (`int()`, `str()`, etc.)\n6. **User Input**: Getting information from users with `input()`\n\n### Key Concepts to Remember:\n\n- Variables are like labeled boxes that store information\n- Different types of data require different handling\n- `input()` always returns a string you need convert when needed\n- Good variable names make your code easier to read\n- You can check any variable's type with `type()`\n\n### For Homework and Practice:\n\n- Practice creating variables of different types\n- Experiment with type conversions\n- Try getting user input and processing it\n- Work on assigned exercises\n\nRemember: Programming is like learning a new language. The more you practice, the more fluent you become. Don't worry if it doesn't all click immediately. That's completely normal!","metadata":{}}]}
